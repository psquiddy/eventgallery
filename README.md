# eventgallery
A simple picture and video uploading gallery, hosted anywhere you want

I've written this so the backend (app.py) runs using the Python flask module, but you can modify this to run on Apache, Nginx, etc.
Basically, it is a simple web page.  Update your header.png and start uploading pictures and video.  This was written while searching
for something similar for my daughter's wedding.  I couldn't find anything that did videos as well, so I wrote it.
